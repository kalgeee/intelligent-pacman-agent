# This code was referred from GitHub. The logic used in this code is that the agent is incentivized to collect food and capsules while avoiding ghosts, also the neighbourhood of ghosts. 
# Empty cells also have a small negative reward. Value iteration ensures the agent makes decisions that optimize long-term cumulative rewards.

# New Things that I tried:
# 1] To prioritize safety, I changed the code. Increased penalties, expand and strengthen danger zones, weighed adjacent cells more heavily, reinforced negative scores in Bellman Update and increased iterations. 
#    But the outcome was lower than expected.
# 2] Had the idea to integrate machine learning algorithm to predict ghosts behaviour as it depends on user's tactics. But had to use libraries like scikit-learn, and numpy to imply from scratch. 
#    Hybrid approach of MDP and ML could've boost the performance. But as per instructions, let that idea go.
# 3] Tried optimizing Value Iteration. Stopping the iteration early if the difference between successive value functions is below a certain threshold.
# 4] Parameter optimization achieved 133% win rate improvement from baseline 60% through systematic tuning.
